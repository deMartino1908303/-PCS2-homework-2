#
# Complete the 'compareTriplets' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER_ARRAY a
#  2. INTEGER_ARRAY b
#

    for value in a:
        if value > b[b_count]:
            player_a += 1
        elif value < b[b_count]:

_____________________________________CODE DESCRIPTION________________________
the for iterate trough the a list and a counter iterate trough the b list
the one who has the higher value get the point, in the case of a draw nobody gets the point
then it puts the scores in an array and returns it
